# QuickLink ðŸ’¨

Despite 87% of recruiters being present on LinkedIn, it can takes days, weeks, or even months trying to get noticed by the software and startup community for a job. Recruiters and software engineers who may already work at your desired company may have premium accounts, private accouns, and etc, making it difficult and time-consuming for passionate developers to connect with industry professionals and jump into the industry. A similar argument can be made with Hackathons and finding developers for startups on platforms like Discord with Nitro accounts and bad-reply games. ***This is where the communication barries start to rise within the software/startup community.***

# QuickLink ðŸ¤”

QuickLink is a platform that reaches out to developers for hackathons, projects, and startups more efficiently. By integrating social-media UI flow, like swiping and accessing messages through just ***one*** button, QuickLink alleviates the extra features of posting on your feed, following accounts, and more, bringing the user right to where they need to be; ***an opportunity to network with industry professionals***. 

QuickLink offers two types of accounts: Hackathon and Job, to ensure that there is a disparity between accounts, making it easier for recruiters to find their relevant developer, as well as allowing an equal and fair opportunity to developers to be seen by the developer and startup community.

# Unique? 
Idea, timing, purpose, and simplicity. Developers and Recruiters can create their accounts with ease by typing their relevant information (i.e, languages, experience, projects, etc) and then signing-in, keeping their profiles organized and cocnsie making it simpler for recruiters to find developers. 

# Networking ðŸŒŽ

Another aspect that is unique to QuickLink is the networking process. Whether it would be for hackathons or jobs, QuickLink's unique ***4-step*** networking process is truly groundbreaking in the way we network. Users send a simple "connection message" to let the desired user know why I they are reaching out to them, allowing for an initial network to be established. It should be noted that further communications can then be continued on an external-platform (i.e, LinkedIn, etc). QuickLink offers - an opportunity to establish networks quicker unlike other platforms like LinkedIn that only strengthen the bonds between networks that have been already established. 

Moreover, with a Tinder-like UI, finding developers to network with is more accessible as you don't have to search their profiles up, and only have to press the "next" button to be prompted by another user if interested.


# Updates
In the coming updates, QuickLink aims to:
- QR Code Integration - Users can scan their QR codes to find the correlated profiles with ease.
- Cross-Compatible: Allow Signing-In from different platforms as well as having the ability to make an account for both types (hackathons, and jobs), and not just one.
- Security Verification Protocols
